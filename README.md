# hello-world
This repository is for a tutorial I'm doing to familiarize myself with GitHub.

My primary interests are in computer programming and simulation, software and algorithm development / testing, and data quality improvement and analysis. After finishing my Master of Science degree from the School of Meteorology at the University of Oklahoma, I worked as a contractor in a software developer / meteorologist position at the Radar Operations Center, Applications Branch in Norman, OK.
